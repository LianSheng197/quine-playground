# JavaScript with Bash Quine Example
This JavaScript program that prints a Bash script that prints back the JavaScript program.

### Environments:
* Node.js: 12.16.1
* Bash: 4.4.20

### Run it

node quine.js | bash
```

Note: I'm not sure which version of Bash is the least required, so I only provide the Bash version of my environment.
